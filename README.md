## 🧩 How It Works

1. City Search – User enters a city name.  
2. Wikidata Query – The app finds the city’s QID (unique Wikidata identifier) and confirms it’s in India.  
3. Fetch People – It queries Wikidata for notable people born, lived, or died in that city.  
4. Display & Filter – Results are shown in cards, with filtering and sorting options.
